Step 1: Download WoR Tool
Download the latest pre-release version of the WoR (Windows on Raspberry Pi) tool from https://www.worproject.ml/downloads.
Extract the downloaded files.

Step 2: Prepare Windows 10 ARM64 ISO
Go to https://uupdump.net.
Choose a Windows 10 ARM64 build (latest stable version recommended).
Download the script (a .zip file) and run it on your Windows PC.
The script will download the required files directly from Microsoft and build a Windows 10 ARM64 ISO file.
Once completed, you will have a Windows 10 ARM64 ISO file ready.

Step 3: Install WoR and Prepare Storage
Insert the prepared storage (MicroSD card or SSD) into your Windows PC.
Open WoR.exe and run it as an administrator.
Follow the wizard with the following steps:
Step 1: Select your storage device (SD/SSD).
Step 2: Point to your Windows 10 ARM64 ISO file.
Step 3: Select your device type: Raspberry Pi 4.
Step 4: Provide the UEFI firmware and drivers.
Step 5: Confirm the installation settings.
WoR will then flash the Windows image to your storage device. This process can take 30-60 minutes, depending on the speed of your storage.

Step 4: Booting Raspberry Pi 4
Insert the prepared storage into your Raspberry Pi 4.
Power on the Raspberry Pi. It will first load into the UEFI firmware screen.
Recommended: Go into the UEFI Settings, change the Boot Order to make your SD/SSD the first boot option, then save and reboot.
The Windows 10 setup will now begin. Select your language, region, and keyboard layout, and configure your system preferences.
For network access, use a USB to Ethernet adapter or a compatible Wi-Fi dongle.
